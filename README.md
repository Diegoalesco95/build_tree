# 🌳 Build a Tree

## 📖 Description

The goal of this kata is to implement trie (or prefix tree) using dictionaries (aka hash maps or hash tables), where:

1. The dictionary keys are the prefixes
2. The value of a leaf node is None in Python, nil in Ruby and null in Groovy, JavaScript and Java.
3. The value for empty input is {} in Python, Ruby, Javascript and Java (empty map) and [:] in Groovy.
